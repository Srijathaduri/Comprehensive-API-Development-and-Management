# üìò User Management API Documentation

## üìå Overview
This RESTful API allows clients to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on user data. It is secured using JWT-based authentication and includes performance optimization and proper error handling.

---

## üîê Authentication
- All endpoints are protected with JWT tokens.
- Use `/login` to obtain a token by providing valid credentials.
- Include the token in the `Authorization` header as:  
  `Bearer <your-token>`
